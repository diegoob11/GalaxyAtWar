## Content 
Game is full of extra stuff (mainly audios and visual) that appear given diverse actions, 
control messages etc. All made by me. (Models used are from the internet but i basically had 
to correct them all so that they work).
- HUD.
- A lot of shaders.
- XML level loading.
- Two types of enemies that behave different.
- Two types of collisions. First AABB then coldet.
- Obb implemented by me. That shows the main objective and minions.
- Two types of bullets implemented.
- World is limited, if the player gets out of range a message will appear and eventually he'll
die.
- Probably some other things i cannot remember...

## Controls 
Use the arrow keys to move and the space key to fire your active gun. 
You can change the active gun with the number keys "1" to "4", although only "1" & "2" are implemented at the moment. "1" selects a normal laser cannon whilst "2" selects a slowing laser beam.
The "P" key lets you change the view.
Move -> arrow keys
Fire -> space keys
Change view -> P key
Change weapon -> numbers 1 to 4
